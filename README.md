The two ipynb files come from two separate group projects for two separate classes. The project for 4061 used a Kaggle dataset surrounding a subset of heart disease data from an
Ohio hospital. We were trying to see the predictability of heart disease based on the dataset. The other project, for 4701, uses data from the city of Chicago about food inspection
passes and failures. We wanted to see how accurately we could predict failures and what sort of things we could suggest to the city to help them keep inspected places from failing.
